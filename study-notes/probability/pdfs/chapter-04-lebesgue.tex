\section{Lebesgue Measure}
\subsection{Motivation: From Probability to Length (Number Theory Version)}
Now suppose that we need to draw a real number at random from the interval [0, 1]. What is the probability that it lies in [0, 0.47)?

In a discrete setting, we count favorable outcomes. Here, outcomes are uncountably infinite — so what does “probability” mean?

We can break down the problem by \textbf{picking digits} one by one. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pick a number: \(0.xy\ldots\)
    \item Either \(x \in \{0,1,2,3\}\) or \(x = 4 \cap y \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 0.6\}\).
\end{itemize}
\[
\#\text{ possibilities} = (4 \cdot 10) + (1 \cdot 7) = 47 \text{ out of } (10 \cdot 10) \text{ possibilities}.
\]
\[
\mathbb{P}(w \in [0,0.47]) = \frac{47}{100} = 0.47 \quad \text{\textcolor{teal}{Some shape of Uniform CDF}}.
\]
Note that this is not the cardinality of the set. 
\subsection{Defining Lebesgue Measure on Intervals}
\begin{df}{Lebesgue Measure on \([0, 1]\)}
Let \( a, b \in [0, 1] \) with \( a < b \). The Lebesgue measure \( \mu \) assigns:
\[
\mu([a, b)) = b - a.
\]
In a more mathematical sense, the "length" of an interval is a "size" to a subset of any general set. Therefore, the essence of a measure, or Lebesgue measure on $\R$, intends to describe the "size" of \textcolor{red}{almost} any general subset in $\R$ by extending this rule to finite unions of disjoint intervals and then, with more care, to broader collections of subsets.
\end{df}


This seems natural — the length of an interval. But to treat it as a true measure in probability context, we need to verify that it satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms and additional key properties.


\subsection{Properties of Lebesgue Measure on $\R$}

\begin{prop}{Basic Properties}
Let \( \mu \) denote Lebesgue measure on $\R$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Length:} \( \mu([a, b)) = b - a \)
    \item \textbf{Normalization:} \( \mu([0, 1]) = 1 \)
    \item \textbf{Translation Invariance:} \( \mu(x + A) = \mu(A), \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \)
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}{Special Cases}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open intervals: \( \mu((a, b)) = \mu([a, b)) = \mu([a, b]) = b - a \)
    \item Single element set:\( \mu(\{a\}) = 0 \)
    \item Countable set: \( \mu(\mathbb{Q} \cap [0, 1]) = 0 \)
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{rmk}
Lebesgue measure assigns zero measure to all finite or countable sets — even dense ones like \( \mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1] \).
\end{rmk}

\subsection{What’s Missing?}

\begin{rmk}{Why Care About Measurability?}
So far, we've assigned lengths to intervals and even countable unions. But it turns out — surprisingly — that not all subsets of \( \mathbb{R} \) can be measured in this way, namely:
\end{rmk}



\begin{eg}{Banach–Tarski Paradox (Informal Version)}
In 3-dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of a solid ball into a finite number of disjoint pieces, which can be reassembled — using only rotations and translations — into two identical copies of the original ball.

This construction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uses only finitely many pieces.
    \item Does not rely on scaling or stretching.
    \item Crucially depends on the Axiom of Choice.
\end{itemize}

But it cannot be carried out with measurable pieces.

\textbf{Implication:} Any measure that is translation invariant and countably additive cannot be defined on \textbf{all} subsets of \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) if we hold onto the axiom of choice.
\end{eg}

%\begin{prop}{Non-existence of extension of length to \text{all} subsets of $\R$}\\
%	There does not exist a function $\mu$ with all the following properties:\\
%	a). $\mu: \mathcal{P}(\R)\rightarrow [0, \infty]$\\
%	b). $\mu(I) = \ell(I) \forall$ open interval $I$ on $\R$\\
%	c). Countable additivity: $\mu\qty(\bigcup_k A_k) = \sum_k \mu(A_k)$ for all disjoint $A_k\subset \R$\\
%	d). Translation invariant: $\mu(t+A) = \mu(A) \ \forall A\subset \R$ and $t\in \R$. 
%\end{prop}
%
%\noindent The only relaxation we can make is $a).$ Instead of defining the function on the entirety of power set of $\R$, we consider a more practice subset of the power set such that the subset is closed under complementation and countable unions. We make the following definition: \\


\begin{rmk}
To avoid these paradoxes, we restrict our attention to a special collection of subsets called \textbf{measurable sets}. In the next chapter, we will construct Lebesgue measure more carefully, using the concept of \textit{outer measure} and the \textbf{Carathéodory criterion} to define which sets can be measured consistently.
\end{rmk}



%To handle these subtleties, we need a more careful construction: starting from \textbf{outer measure} and identifying \textbf{measurable sets} via Carathéodory’s criterion. This will be the subject of the next chapter.




%\begin{df}{Lebesgue Measure on $\R\cap [0,1]$}\\
%More Generally, for \(a, b \in \mathbb{R} \cap [0,1]\), \(a < b\), Lebesgue Measure is a measure defined on the power set of $\mathbb{R} \cap [0,1]$ \textcolor{red}{(Warning! this is ideal but is not true. reason to be discussed in the next chapter.)} onto $\R$ such that the mapping is non-negative and sigma-additive. It is defined by the following: 
%\[
%\mathbb{P}([0,a)) = a, \quad \mathbb{P}([0,b)) = b.
%\]
%\[
%\mathbb{P}([a,b)) = \mathbb{P}([0,b)) - \mathbb{P}([0,a)) = b - a.
%\]
%\end{df}
%
%\begin{prop}{Additional Features on Lebesgue Measure}
%\begin{itemize}
%        \item Unity: $\mathbb{P}([0, 1]) = 1$ 
%    	\item Translational Invariant: $\mathbb{P}(x + A) = \mathbb{P}(A), \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$
%\end{itemize}
%\end{prop}
%
%
%\begin{prop}{}
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item \textbf{Open interval: } \(\mathbb{P}((a,b)) = \lim_{n \to 0} \mathbb{P}((a+\frac{1}{n},b)) = \lim_{n \to 0} b-(a+\frac{1}{n}) = b-a\).
%    \item \textbf{Single element: } \(\mathbb{P}(\qty{a}) = \mathbb{P}([a,b]) - \mathbb{P}((a,b)) = b-a - (b-a) = 0 \).
%    \item \textbf{Closed interval: } \(\mathbb{P}([a,b]) = \mathbb{P}([a,b)) + \mathbb{P}(\{b\}) = \mathbb{P}([a,b]) = b - a.\)
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{rmk}
%Using Kolmogorov axioms for measures, \(A \subset [0,1]\), finite or countable, \(\mathbb{P}(A) = 0\).
%As a result, \(\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]) = 0.\)

%\section*{Outer Measure}
%\subsection*{Motivation and Definition of Outer Measure}
%Recall the definition of upper and lower Darboux sum in Riemann integral setting: 
%$$U(f) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sup_{x\in [x_i, x_{i+1}]}{f(x)} \cdot \underbrace{(x_{i+1} - x_i)}_{\text{length}}$$
%Definition of Riemann non-integrable involves the upper integral and the lower integral as two limits do not agree, which likely boils down to some partitions $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ not well-defined. Therefore, to propose a fix, we are motivated to properly define the "length" of any general subset of $\R$. \\
%
%\begin{df}{Length}
%    The length $\ell(I)$ of some open interval $I\subset \R$ is a function defined by
%    $$\ell(I) =
%    \begin{cases}
%         b-a, & I = (b-a), a<b, a, b\in \R\\
%         0,  & I = \emptyset, \\
%         \infty & I = (-\infty, a), a\in \R\\
%         \infty & I = (a, \infty), a\in \R
%    \end{cases}$$
%\end{df}
%Then suppose $A\subset \R$. The size of $A$ can at most be the \textbf{sum of lengths of a sequence of open intervals $I$ whose union contains} $A$. Taking the infimum of such sums over all possible sequences of $I$, we obtain the outer measure of $A$, i.e.\\
%
%\begin{df}{Outer Measure, $\abs{A}$}
%    For $A\subset \R$,
%    $$\abs{A} \equiv \inf\qty{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \ell(I_k)\mid I_k \text{ open, } A\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k }$$
%\end{df}
%
%\begin{prop}{Finite sets have outer measure 0} 
%\end{prop}
%
%\subsubsection{Properties of Outer Measure}
%\begin{prop}{Countable subsets of $\R$ have outer measure 0} 
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{prop}{Order preserving of outer measure}\\
%If $A\subset B\subset \R$, then $\abs{A}\leq\abs{B}$
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{df}{Translation}
%    For any $A\subset \R, t\in \R$, the translation $t+A$ is defined by
%    \[t+A = \qty{t+a \mid a\in A}\]
%\end{df}
%Note that the length function should be translation invariant. Therefore, we obtain the proposition that outer measure is translation invariant. \\
%
%\begin{prop}{Outer measure is translation invariant}\\
%Suppose $t\in \R$ and $A\subset \R$, then $\abs{t+A} = \abs{A}$.
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{prop}{Countable Sub-additivity of outer measure}
%Suppose $A_1, A_2, \dots, \subset \R$. Then 
%$$\abs{\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k} \leq \sum_{k=1}^\infty \abs{A_k}$$	
%Note that this implies finite sub-additivity which could come handy in proof techniques: 
%$$\abs{A_1\cup \dots \cup A_n} \leq \abs{A_1} + \dots + \abs{A_n}$$
%\end{prop}
%
%\subsection*{Outer Measure of Closed Bounded Interval}
%It is apparent for any closed interval $[a, b]$, we can construct a sequence of open cover $(a-\ep, b+\ep)$ and arbitrarily shrink $\ep$. We obtain $\abs{[a, b]} \leq b-a$. However, the other direction requires completeness of $\R$. \\
%
%\begin{prop}{$\abs{[a, b]} = b-a$}\\
%Suppose $a, b\in \R, a<b$. Then $\abs{[a, b]} = b-a$. 
%Proof: \ref{prof:closed interval}
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{prop}{Non-trivial intervals are uncountable}\\
%	Every \textbf{interval} in $\R$ that contains at least two distinct terms is uncountable. 
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{prop}{Non-additivity}\\
%	$\exists A, B\subset \R$ disjoint such that $\abs{A\cup B} \neq \abs{A} + \abs{B}$. 
%\end{prop}
