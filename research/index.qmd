## ðŸ”¬ Honors Thesis

**Title:** *Social Networks in Aid Allocation: A Comparative Analysis of Social Welfare*  
**Advisor:** [Prof. Stephen O'Connell](https://www.stephenoconnell.org/) (Department of Economics, Emory University)  

**Abstract:**  
I develop and assess a social welfare program targeting plan that incorporates network spillover eï¬€ects. I compare it to traditional capacity and deprivation-based targeting methods. I analyze how spillover targeting aï¬€ects aid distribution, program eï¬€ectiveness among beneficiaries, and overall economic well-being and social cohesion of the community. The findings reveal that the overlap in recipient selection between spillover targeting and either of the traditional methods is significantly smaller than the overlap between the two traditional methods. Additionally, spillover targeting improves program eï¬€ectiveness among beneficiaries compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, spillover targeting enhances the overall economic well-being and social cohesion of the community more than other targeting strategies. This research highlights the importance of incorporating network spillover eï¬€ects into financial aid strategies and provides a framework for integrating network considerations into aid distribution policies.
